Follow GitHub Flow for branching
Branch naming: feature/<description>, fix/<description>, refactor/<description>
Commit messages describe the goal/why, not code changes
Focus on what and why, not how in commit messages
Never use git merge - always use git rebase to update branches
Use git rebase <target-branch> to update with base branch changes
Keep commit history linear for easier understanding
Commit messages may contain markdown lists for extraordinary circumstances
Use two newlines to separate main message from list, indent list items with two spaces
